## Tech Search

- Tech search uses react and Eventbrite api to show local tech related events near and around San Jose.

##### What problem does it seek to solve? 
 Living in San Jose, there feels like a gap in opportunities for events a to feel connected to the center of the Tech Hub when most events are happening 40-50 miles away in San Francisco. I have found that there seems to be a noticeable difference in the amount of  tech events offered in San Jose area. This app hopes to make it easier for those not at the city center.

##### How would it add value to Eventbriteâ€™s product?
This app will be a centralized hub for all who want to be more involved in events near and around San Jose. Rather then having to search through all other Eventbrite events this is a one stop shop for tech near and around Sn.

##### Why does it even matter?
  For new Devs, The only way to improve on your code and to learn is to be in a community of like minded people. If there is a gap in that community,  it is important to find ways to overcome and fill that. Community matters.
  
  
##### What stretch goals/features do you aspire to build out?
In the future I would like to see a subscriber email newsletter to be able to receive updates and upcoming events.
 I would also like to see long term goal, of having  opportunities for companies to partner with private individuals to host events. This is important for the private individuals that want to hold events but face issues of lack of hosting location or the affordability.
